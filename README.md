#SD Gophers Challenge for December 2016

## Holiday Cards Generator.

For tonight's challenge, we will be using a third party library, called [gofpdf](https://github.com/jung-kurt/gofpdf). 

## Challenge 1.

Create a simple holiday card for your friends and family; output it as a pdf. The card should have a picture and least one line of text.

If you need ideas for what [holiday cards look like look here](https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1920&bih=1006&q=holiday+card+templates&oq=holiday+card+&gs_l=img.3.3.0l10.1451.3673.0.8726.13.11.0.2.2.0.100.859.9j1.10.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..1.12.863.hvktUsSVqsA).

## Challenge 2.

Your application should allow one to specify an image. The image should be resized and fit the card you created above. The application should take a line of text that will replace the default line of text from above.

## Challenge 3.

The application should take a new line separated list of people names, and generate a card including each name.

## Challenge 3a.

The subject text should now be a template, indicating where the application will insert the name.
